# CMOS Implemented NOR Gate
CMOS Implemented NOR Gate is designed using Synopsys custom design tools.

## Abstract
NOR gate is a universal gate. It is a logically inverted version of the basic OR gate. In this implementation it has two inputs (A & B) with an output (Y). Its logical equation is derived as Y=(A+B)'.
